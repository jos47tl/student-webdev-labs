## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete exercises 1-3 on my own, but exercise 4 had me referencing the video to help me finish. I also needed the video for exercise one to fix a warning thrown up by the W3C Markup Validation tool. This is because I was nesting an unordered list in an ordered list. I fixed this by following the video and nesting the unordered list under a list element. Other than that, all the material required to do the first three exercises were covered in the slides/lectures. However, exercise four required the use of fieldset elements which are not in the slides. The spacing of the elements on the page was also hard to nail down. After creating all the elements of the pages I spent a good chunk of time trying to align everything to match the examples. I should ask about the differences between using the div and br tags to separate elements into separate lines. The solution videos seem to mix and match div and br tags to create space.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete this exercise on my own because we had gone over it in class and there was a similar exercise in the previous week's lab. This was helpful in reinforcing some old lessons in accessibility. I made sure that the name and input fields had associated labels with placeholder values. I also grouped the radio buttons together in a fieldset and made the text a legend. Finally, I made sure that each radio button was properly labelled so the label could be clicked to select the option. Pretty easy overall but it's good practice.
